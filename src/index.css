/* 
Your style handling has a good approach, creating a css for each component makes it easier to maintain and understand.

I suggest you to follow the class convention by using kebab-case for class names. 

In your next projects you can try to experiment with relative units like rem, em, vh, vw, etc. to make your components more responsive.

Try to test your components in different screen sizes to see how they behave and if they need any adjustments.
